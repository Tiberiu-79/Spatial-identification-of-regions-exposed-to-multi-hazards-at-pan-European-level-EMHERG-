# EMHERG


The repository provides a code that (1) performs a hotspot analysis on the assets (built-up and population) exposed to single hazards (coastal floods, earthquakes, river floods, landslides, subsidence, and wildfires) (2) combines single hazards hotspots into a multi-hazard hotspots identifying the regions exposed to multi-hazards at European level.
# Data requirements:
- Built-up and population exposure data available from the DRMKC Risk Data Hub (https://drmkc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/risk-data-hub/#/).
- GDP per Capita at NUTS3 available from Eurostat: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?oldid=500199
- Local Administrative units as.shp files available from Eurostat: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/local-administrative-units.
- NUT3 and EU27+UK+EFTA Countries as .shp files available from Eurostat: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units
- URAU 2021 data: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/urban-audit

  The data used for this analysis is also made available in a dedicated [directory](https://github.com/Tiberiu-79/Spatial-identification-of-regions-exposed-to-multi-hazards-at-pan-European-level-EMHERG-/tree/main/Data_MH) accesible from this repository. 
# Python requirements:
For the development of the code, Python version 3.7 was used,  with libraries dependencies managed within the Anaconda3 environment.
